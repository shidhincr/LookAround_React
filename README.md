LookAround_React
=====================

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/shidhincr/LookAround_React.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Trying to Learn ReactJS and Flux Architecture by creating a simple application. This Repo is a clone of the original  [LookAround](https://github.com/shidhincr/LookAround) application created for learning AngularJS.


What we're going to do ?
========================
It'll be a simple application using Google maps API to load the location service and find the nearest ATM,Bar,Hotels, Pubs ..etc. Google is already providing these informations in their Goole+ page –– but as I said earlier, we'll be mimicking the same for our learning purpose.
